Performing analysis on the weather in Hawaii.
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
This analysis was created for surfer and investor W. Avy, where we obtained the temperature trends of Oahu, Hawaii so we can decide in which month it would be optimal to open a surf and shakes store. The analysis presented has a greater focus on the temperatures of June and December from the last 7 years to make sure that the store will have a positive revenue all year round and prevent failure.
## Results

### Outcomes
After comparing the different temperatures of June and December the following information is important to make a decision

* There is not a big difference in temperature between June and December

As seen in the table the average temperature in June is 75°F, maximum of 85° and minimum of 64° while in December the average temperature is 71°F, maximum of 83°F and minimum of 56°F so there isn't a huge differences in the temperatures of each month where it would decrease sales on an especific time of the year.

* Precipitation Differs from both months

While there is only a precipitation of .14 inches in Junes it goes up to .22 inches in December which could be inconvinient for the store since customers are not looking for ice cream or surf gear during the rain especially when the maximum in December goes all the way up to 6 inches
